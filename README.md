## 1. Creational Design Pattern
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

But everyone knows an object is created by using new keyword in java. For example:
```
StudentRecord s1=new StudentRecord();  
```
Hard-Coded code is not the good programming approach. Here, we are creating the instance by using the new keyword. Sometimes, the nature of the object must be changed according to the nature of the program. In such cases, we must get the help of creational design patterns to provide more general and flexible approach.
### 1.1 Factory Pattern
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just **`define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate`**. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as **`Virtual Constructor`**.
#### Advantage of Factory Design Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
- It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.
#### Usage of Factory Design Pattern
- When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
- When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
- When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
#### UML for Factory Method Pattern
- We are going to create a Plan abstract class and concrete classes that extends the Plan abstract class. A factory class GetPlanFactory is defined as a next step.
- GenerateBill class will use GetPlanFactory to get a Plan object. It will pass information (DOMESTICPLAN / COMMERCIALPLAN / INSTITUTIONALPLAN) to GetPalnFactory to get the type of object it needs.
